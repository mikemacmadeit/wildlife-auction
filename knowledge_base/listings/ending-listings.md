# Ending or Removing Listings

Learn when and how to end or remove your listings.

## When You Can End a Listing

**Fixed Price Listings:**
- Can be ended at any time
- No restrictions (unless there's a pending order)

**Auction Listings:**
- Can be ended early if no bids placed
- Cannot be ended if bids exist (protects buyers)
- Automatically ends when duration expires

## How to End a Listing

1. Go to **Seller Dashboard** → **My Listings**
2. Find the listing you want to end
3. Click **"End Listing"** or **"Remove"**
4. Confirm the action

## What Happens When You End

- Listing is removed from search results
- Buyers can no longer purchase or bid
- You can still view the listing in your dashboard
- Any pending orders continue normally

## Important Notes

**Before Ending:**
- Check for any pending orders
- Consider if you want to relist later
- Ending cannot be undone

**After Ending:**
- You can create a new listing if needed
- Previous listing data is saved for reference

## Ending vs. Removing

- **Ending**: Listing is marked as ended, visible in your history
- **Removing**: Listing is deleted (use carefully)

## Troubleshooting

**Can't end listing?**
- Check if there are active bids or orders
- Contact support if you believe there's an error
