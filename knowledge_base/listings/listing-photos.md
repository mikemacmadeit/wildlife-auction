## Photo Requirements

- **At least one photo** is required

## Photo Tips

- Show the item in its best condition

## Uploading Photos

1. Click **"Add Photos"** when creating your listing
2. Select photos from your device
3. Arrange photos in order (first photo is the cover)
4. Add captions if needed (optional)

## Photo Guidelines

**Do:**
- Show the actual item you're selling

- Show any flaws or wear honestly
- Include photos of paperwork/certificates if relevant

**Don't:**
