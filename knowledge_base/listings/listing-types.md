# Understanding Listing Types

Wildlife Exchange offers different listing types to suit your selling needs.

## Auction Listings

**How it works:**
- Set a starting bid
- Buyers place bids over time
- Highest bid wins when auction ends
- Optional reserve price (minimum you'll accept)

**Best for:**
- Items with uncertain market value
- Creating competitive bidding
- Time-sensitive sales

**Duration:** 1, 3, 5, 7, or 10 days

## Fixed Price Listings

**How it works:**
- Set a fixed price
- Buyers can purchase immediately
- Optional "Best Offer" feature
- Stays active until sold or removed

**Best for:**
- Items with known market value
- Quick sales
- Multiple quantity items

**Best Offer:**
- Buyers can make offers below asking price
- You can accept, counter, or decline
- Helps negotiate the best price

## Choosing the Right Type

**Use Auction if:**
- You want competitive bidding
- Market value is uncertain
- You have a time limit

**Use Fixed Price if:**
- You know your price
- You want immediate sales
- You're selling multiple items

## Changing Listing Type

- You can change type before publishing
- Once published with bids, type cannot be changed
- Create a new listing if you need to change type
