# Understanding Listing Fees

Agchange charges fees when your item sells. Here's how it works.

## When Fees Apply

- Fees are only charged when an item **sells**
- No fees for creating listings
- No fees if your item doesn't sell

## Fee Structure

Fees are based on your seller tier:

- **Standard Tier**: 7% platform fee
- **Priority Tier**: 5% platform fee
- **Premier Tier**: 4% platform fee

## What's Included

Platform fees cover:
- Payment processing
- Buyer protection
- Dispute resolution
- Platform maintenance

## Additional Costs

- Payment processing fees (handled by payment provider)
- Optional listing upgrades (if available)

## Fee Calculation

Fees are calculated on the final sale price:
- Example: $1,000 sale at 7% = $70 platform fee
- You receive: $930 (minus payment processing)

## Payment Timing

- Fees are deducted from sale proceeds
- You receive net amount after fees
- Payout timing depends on delivery confirmation

## Reducing Fees

- Upgrade to Priority or Premier tier for lower fees
- Fees are automatically applied - no manual calculation needed
