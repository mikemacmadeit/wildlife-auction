# Protected Transactions

Protected transactions provide additional buyer protection and seller benefits.

## What is Protection?

- **Extended protection window** - More time for buyer to inspect
- **Held funds** - Payment held until protection window ends
- **Dispute support** - Enhanced dispute resolution
- **Peace of mind** - For both buyers and sellers

## For Buyers

### Benefits

- **Longer inspection period** - 7 or 14 days (seller chooses)
- **Secure payment** - Funds held until you're satisfied
- **Better dispute process** - Enhanced support if issues arise
- **Confidence** - Know you're protected

### How It Works

1. **Purchase item** with protection enabled
2. **Receive item** and inspect
3. **Confirm delivery** - Protection window starts
4. **Inspect thoroughly** - Use full protection period
5. **Report issues** if any during protection window
6. **Funds released** to seller after protection period (if no issues)

## For Sellers

### Benefits

- **Attract more buyers** - Protection increases buyer confidence
- **Higher prices** - Buyers may pay more for protected items
- **Fewer disputes** - Protection reduces misunderstandings
- **Faster sales** - Buyers more likely to purchase

### Enabling Protection

- **Optional feature** - Enable when creating listing
- **Choose duration** - 7 or 14 days
- **Slight fee** - May apply (check current pricing)
- **Worth it** - Often results in higher sale prices

## Protection Window

- **Starts** when buyer confirms delivery
- **Duration** - 7 or 14 days (seller's choice)
- **Buyer can report issues** during this time
- **Funds held** until window expires or dispute resolved

## Important Notes

- **Not insurance** - Protection is for item condition, not damage
- **Buyer responsibility** - Must inspect and report issues promptly
- **Seller benefit** - Protection often increases sale price
- **Mutual benefit** - Protects both parties
