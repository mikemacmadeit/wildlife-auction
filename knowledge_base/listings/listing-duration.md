# Auction Duration and Timing

Understanding how auction duration works and choosing the right length.

## Duration Options

- **1 day** - Quick auction, urgent sales
- **3 days** - Standard short auction
- **5 days** - Balanced option
- **7 days** - Longer auction, more exposure
- **10 days** - Maximum duration, maximum visibility

## Choosing Duration

**Shorter (1-3 days):**
- **Urgent sales** - Need to sell quickly
- **High-demand items** - Will sell fast anyway
- **Time-sensitive** - Limited availability

**Medium (5 days):**
- **Balanced approach** - Good exposure without dragging on
- **Most common choice** - Works for most items
- **Competitive bidding** - Enough time for bidding wars

**Longer (7-10 days):**
- **Rare or valuable items** - Need more time to find buyers
- **Maximum exposure** - Reach more potential buyers
- **Complex items** - Buyers need time to research

## Timing Considerations

- **Start time** - When auction goes live
- **End time** - When auction closes
- **Time zones** - Consider buyer time zones
- **Weekend vs weekday** - May affect bidding activity

## Extension Rules

- **Automatic extension** - If bid placed in final minutes (if enabled)
- **No manual extension** - Duration is set when listing is created
- **Ends on time** - Auction closes at specified end time

## Best Practices

- **Choose based on item** - Rare items need more time
- **Consider competition** - More listings = longer duration may help
- **Think about buyers** - Give them time to research and bid
- **Set realistic duration** - Don't make it too short or too long
