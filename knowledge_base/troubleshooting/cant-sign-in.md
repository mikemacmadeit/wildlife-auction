# Can't Sign In

Having trouble signing in to your Agchange account? This guide covers the most common sign-in issues and how to fix them.

## Quick Fixes (Try These First)

1. **Check your email and password** - Make sure both are correct (passwords are case-sensitive)
2. **Verify your email** - Check if you've verified your email address
3. **Clear browser cache** - Sometimes cached data causes issues
4. **Try a different browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
5. **Try incognito/private mode** - This rules out browser extension issues

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Wrong Password" or "Invalid Credentials"

**What this means:** The email or password you entered doesn't match our records.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check caps lock** - Passwords are case-sensitive. Make sure caps lock is off
2. **Verify spelling** - Double-check your password for typos
3. **Check for spaces** - Make sure there are no extra spaces before or after your password
4. **Try password reset** - If you've forgotten your password:
   - Click "Forgot Password" on the sign-in page
   - Enter your email address
   - Check your email (and spam folder) for the reset link
   - Click the link and create a new password
   - Try signing in with the new password

### Issue: "User Not Found" or "Account Doesn't Exist"

**What this means:** No account exists with that email address.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check email spelling** - Make sure you're using the correct email address
2. **Try different email** - If you have multiple email addresses, try the one you used to sign up
3. **Check if you signed up** - Make sure you completed the sign-up process
4. **Sign up again** - If you never completed sign-up, you may need to create an account

### Issue: "Email Not Verified" or "Please Verify Your Email"

**What this means:** You need to verify your email address before you can sign in.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check your inbox** - Look for a verification email from Agchange
2. **Check spam folder** - Verification emails sometimes go to spam
3. **Resend verification email:**
   - Go to the sign-in page
   - Look for "Resend Verification Email" link
   - Enter your email and click send
   - Check your email and click the verification link
4. **Wait a few minutes** - Emails can take 2-5 minutes to arrive

### Issue: "Too Many Failed Attempts" or "Account Temporarily Locked"

**What this means:** You've tried to sign in too many times with the wrong password.

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait 15-30 minutes** - The lockout is temporary
2. **Use password reset** - This will unlock your account and let you set a new password
3. **Contact support** - If you're still locked out after waiting

### Issue: Page Won't Load or Keeps Refreshing

**Solutions:**
1. **Clear browser cache and cookies:**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Firefox: Settings → Privacy → Clear Data

2. **Disable browser extensions** - Some extensions can interfere with sign-in
3. **Try a different browser** - This helps identify if it's browser-specific
4. **Check your internet connection** - Make sure you have a stable connection
5. **Try on mobile** - If desktop isn't working, try signing in on your phone

### Issue: "Something Went Wrong" or Generic Error

**What this means:** There may be a temporary server issue or account problem.

**Solutions:**
