# Listing Not Appearing in Search

If your listing isn't showing up in search results, here's what to check.

## Common Reasons

### Listing Status
- **Draft status** - Must be published to appear
- **Pending review** - Compliance review may delay appearance
- **Ended/Removed** - Ended listings don't appear in active search

### Search Filters
- **Category filter** - Make sure you're searching correct category
- **Location filter** - Check if location filter is applied
- **Price range** - Verify price is within search range

### Timing
- **Just published** - May take a few minutes to index
- **Search cache** - Try refreshing or waiting a moment

## Solutions

### Check Listing Status
1. Go to **Seller Dashboard** → **My Listings**
2. Check status of your listing
3. Ensure it's **"Active"** not "Draft" or "Pending"

### Verify Listing Details

- **Photos** are uploaded

### Wait and Refresh
