# What If I Don't Receive My Order?

If your order hasn't arrived or you're having delivery issues, here's what to do.

## First Steps

### 1. Check Order Status

**How to check:**
1. Go to "My Orders" in your dashboard
2. Click on the order in question
3. Check the order status
4. Look for any messages from the seller
5. Check delivery timeline

**What to look for:**
- Is payment still pending? (ACH/wire transfers take time)
- Has seller contacted you?
- What does the order status say?
- Are there any delivery updates?

### 2. Contact the Seller

**Always contact seller first:**
1. Go to your order page
2. Click "Message Seller" or "Contact Seller"
3. Ask about delivery status
4. Be polite and specific
5. Give seller 24-48 hours to respond

**What to ask:**
- "Hi, I wanted to check on the delivery status of my order. When can I expect to receive it?"
- "I haven't received any delivery updates. Could you let me know the status?"
- "Is there a tracking number or delivery date I should know about?"

**Why contact seller first:**
- Most issues are resolved with communication
- Sellers may be waiting for payment to clear
- Delivery may be scheduled but not yet happened
- Seller may have questions about delivery location

### 3. Check Your Messages

**Check for seller communication:**
- Go to "Messages" in your dashboard
- Look for messages from the seller
- Check your email for order updates
- Seller may have sent delivery information

## Common Scenarios

**If you used ACH or wire transfer:**
- Payment takes 3-5 business days (ACH) or 1-3 days (wire)
- Seller won't ship until payment clears
- This is normal and expected
- Check order status - it will show "Payment Pending"

**What to do:**
- Wait for payment to clear (check order status)
- Seller will proceed once payment is confirmed
- Contact seller to confirm they received payment
- Be patient - this is part of the process

### Scenario 2: Seller Hasn't Contacted You

**If seller hasn't reached out:**
- Wait 48 hours (sellers may be busy)
- Send a polite message asking about delivery
- Check if seller has been active on the platform
- Contact support if no response after 3 days

**What to do:**
1. Send message: "Hi, I wanted to check on delivery arrangements for my order. When would be a good time to discuss?"
2. Wait 24-48 hours for response
3. If no response, send follow-up
4. Contact support if still no response

### Scenario 3: Delivery Is Delayed

**If delivery is taking longer than expected:**
- Communicate with seller about timeline
- Check if there are delays (weather, transport issues)
- Be patient but stay in communication
- Set a reasonable deadline with seller

**What to do:**
- Ask seller for updated timeline
- Discuss what's causing the delay
- Agree on a new delivery date

### Scenario 4: Item Never Arrived

**If item was supposed to be delivered but never came:**
