## Before You Start

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Access the Create Listing Page

2. **Click "Sell"** in the top navigation, OR
3. **Go to Dashboard** → **"Create Listing"** button, OR
4. **Navigate to** `/dashboard/listings/new`

### Step 2: Choose Listing Type

Select how you want to sell:

- **Auction** - Buyers bid, highest bid wins at auction end
- **Fixed Price** - Set a price, buyer pays immediately
- **Best Offer** - Accept offers from buyers (can be combined with Fixed Price)

### Step 3: Select Category

Choose the appropriate category for your animal:

- **Registered & Specialty Livestock** - Registered ranch species, game animals
- **Cattle & Livestock** - Cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, etc.
- **Horses & Equestrian** - Horses, ponies, donkeys, mules
- **Sporting & Working Dogs** - Hunting dogs, working dogs, etc.

### Step 4: Add Basic Information

- Keep it under 100 characters

**Description:**
- Write a detailed description
- Include health information, training, temperament
- Mention any paperwork, registration, or documentation
- Be honest about any issues or special needs
- Minimum 50 characters, recommended 200-500 words

### Step 5: Upload Photos

**Photo Requirements:**
- **At least 1 photo required**, but 3-5 photos recommended
- **High quality** - Clear, well-lit photos
- **Show different angles** - Front, side, back views

### Step 6: Set Location

2. Or use the map to select your location
3. Be specific enough for buyers to plan pickup/delivery

**For Fixed Price:**
- **Fixed Price** - The price buyers will pay
- **Best Offer** - Optional, allows buyers to make offers

**Pricing Tips:**
- Research similar listings to set competitive pricing

### Step 8: Add Attributes
