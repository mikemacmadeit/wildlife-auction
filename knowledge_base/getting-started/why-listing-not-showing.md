# Why Is My Listing Not Showing?

If your listing isn't appearing in search results or browse pages, here are common reasons and solutions.

## Common Reasons

### 1. Listing Is Still Under Review

**How to check:**

**What to do:**
- **Wait 24-48 hours** - Review typically takes 1-2 business days

**What to do:**
1. **Read the rejection reason** - Admin will explain what needs to be fixed

### 3. Listing Status Is "Draft"

**What this means:** You saved the listing but didn't publish it.

**What to do:**
1. **Click on the draft listing**

### 4. Listing Has Ended or Sold

- Check the listing end date

**What to do:**
- **Create a new listing** if you want to sell again
- **View completed listings** in "My Listings" → "Completed"

### 5. Search Filters Are Hiding It

**What this means:** The filters you or buyers are using exclude your listing.

**Common filters that hide listings:**
- **Location** - If buyer searches for different location
- **Price range** - If your price is outside the range
- **Category** - If wrong category selected
- **Listing type** - If searching for "Auction" but yours is "Fixed Price"
- **Status** - If searching "Active" but yours is "Pending"

**What to do:**
- **Check your listing details** - Make sure category, location, price are correct
- **Try searching without filters** - See if it appears in general browse
- **Ask someone else to search** - They may see it if you're logged in

### 6. Email Not Verified

**What this means:** Unverified accounts can't publish listings.

**How to check:**
- Go to Account Settings
- Check email verification status
- Look for "Email Verified" badge

**What to do:**
1. **Check your email** for verification link
2. **Click the verification link**
3. **Try publishing again** after verification

### 7. Payment Account Not Connected

**What this means:** Sellers need Stripe connected to receive payments and publish listings.

**How to check:**
- Go to Seller Dashboard or Account Settings
- Look for "Payment Account" or "Stripe" section
- Check if it shows "Connected" or "Not Connected"

**What to do:**
1. **Go to payment settings**
2. **Click "Connect Stripe"** or "Set Up Payments"
3. **Complete Stripe onboarding**
4. **Try publishing listing again**

### 8. Listing Is Too New

**What this means:** Just-published listings can take a few minutes to appear in search.

**What to do:**
- **Wait 5-10 minutes** after approval
- **Refresh the browse page**
- **Try searching for your listing title**
- **Check "My Listings"** to confirm status is "Active"

### 9. Browser Cache Issue

2. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Try incognito/private mode**
