## Common Questions

### How long is protection active?

Protection is active from payment until you confirm delivery. Once you confirm, funds are released and protection ends.

### Can I get refund after confirming?

If you confirm delivery, protection ends. However, you can still contact seller or support if issues arise later, though options may be limited.

### What if seller asks for payment outside platform?

Never pay outside the platform. This removes all protection. Report seller to support immediately.

### How do I know protection is active?

Your order status will show payment processed and funds held. Protection is active until you confirm delivery.
