# Payment Protection and Security

Your payments are protected and secure on Agchange.

## How Protection Works

- **Funds are held securely** until delivery is confirmed
- **You have a protection window** to inspect your purchase
- **Dispute resolution** available if issues arise
- **Refund process** for eligible cases

## Secure Payment Processing

- **Encrypted transactions** - All payment data is encrypted
- **PCI compliant** - Meets industry security standards
- **No storage** - Payment details aren't stored on our servers
- **Trusted processors** - Uses established payment providers

## Buyer Protection Window

After delivery confirmation:
- **Inspection period** to verify item matches listing
- **Time to report issues** if something's wrong
- **Dispute process** available during this window

## What's Protected

- **Item not as described** - Significant differences from listing
- **Item not received** - Delivery issues or non-delivery
- **Damaged items** - Damage during shipping
- **Fraud** - Seller misrepresentation

## What's Not Protected

- **Buyer's remorse** - Changed your mind
- **Minor differences** - Small variations from photos
- **Outside protection window** - Issues reported too late
- **Violations of terms** - Prohibited transactions

## Dispute Process

1. **Contact seller first** - Try to resolve directly
2. **Open a dispute** if needed
3. **Provide evidence** (photos, messages, etc.)
4. **Admin reviews** and makes decision
5. **Resolution** - Refund or other remedy

## Security Tips

- **Never share payment details** outside the platform
- **Use official checkout** - Don't pay sellers directly
- **Keep records** of all transactions
- **Report suspicious activity** immediately
