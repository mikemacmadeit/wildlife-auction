# How Bidding Works

Understanding the bidding process helps you participate successfully in auctions.

## Basic Bidding

1. **Find an auction** you're interested in
2. **Enter your bid amount** (must be higher than current bid)
3. **Place your bid**
4. **You're the high bidder** (until someone outbids you)

## Bid Requirements

- **Minimum bid**: Must be higher than current bid
- **Bid increments**: Usually $1 or $5 increments (varies by listing)
- **Verified email**: Required to place bids
- **Account in good standing**: No restrictions

## Winning an Auction

- **Highest bid when auction ends** wins
- **Reserve price**: If reserve isn't met, seller may not sell
- **Notification**: You'll be notified if you win
- **Checkout**: Complete purchase within specified time

## Being Outbid

- **You'll be notified** if someone outbids you
- **Place a new bid** if you want to continue
- **No automatic bidding** - you must place each bid manually

## Bid Tips

- Research the item's value first
- Read the listing description carefully

## After Winning
