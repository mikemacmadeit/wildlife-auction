# How Bidding Works - Complete Guide

Complete guide to understanding and participating in auctions on Wildlife Exchange.

## Understanding Auctions

**What is an auction?**
- Sellers list items with a starting bid
- Buyers place bids to compete
- Highest bid wins when auction ends
- You can set a maximum bid (proxy bidding)

**Auction timeline:**
- Auction has a start time and end time
- Bidding happens during the auction period
- Auction ends at the specified time
- Highest bidder wins (if above reserve price)

## Types of Bids

### Regular Bid

**How it works:**
- You enter a specific bid amount
- Your bid is placed immediately
- You become the high bidder (if your bid is highest)
- Others can outbid you

**When to use:**
- You want to bid a specific amount
- You're monitoring the auction closely
- You want to bid incrementally

### Maximum Bid (Proxy Bidding)

**How it works:**
- You set your maximum bid amount
- System bids automatically for you
- Bids only as much as needed to stay ahead
- Up to your maximum amount

**Example:**
- Current bid: $100
- You set maximum: $500
- System bids $105 (next increment)
- If someone bids $110, system bids $115
- Continues until your $500 maximum or you win

**Benefits:**
- Don't need to monitor constantly
- Bids automatically up to your limit
- Saves time and effort
- Competitive advantage

**When to use:**
- You know your maximum price
- You can't monitor auction constantly
- You want to stay competitive
- Auction is ending soon

## How to Place a Bid

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Find an auction listing**
   - Browse or search for items
   - Look for "Auction" listing type
   - Check auction end time

2. **Review auction details**
   - Starting bid amount
   - Current high bid
   - Reserve price (if set)
   - Time remaining
   - Bid increments

3. **Click "Place Bid" or "Bid Now"**
   - Button on the listing page
   - Opens bid dialog

4. **Enter your bid**
   - **Regular bid:** Enter specific amount
   - **Maximum bid:** Enter your maximum amount
   - Must be higher than current bid
   - Must meet minimum increment

5. **Confirm your bid**
   - Review bid amount
   - Confirm you want to bid
   - Click "Confirm Bid"

6. **Bid is placed**
   - You'll see confirmation
   - Current bid updates
   - You'll be notified of activity

## Bid Requirements

**To place a bid, you need:**
- ✅ Signed in to your account
- ✅ Verified email address
- ✅ Payment method on file (for if you win)
- ✅ Sufficient funds available

**Bid rules:**
- Must be higher than current bid
- Must meet minimum increment
- Must be above starting bid

## Understanding Reserve Price

**What is reserve price?**
- Minimum price seller will accept
- Not visible to buyers
- Auction only sells if bid meets reserve
- Protects seller from selling too low

**How it works:**
- If final bid is below reserve, auction doesn't sell
- If final bid meets or exceeds reserve, you win
- You won't know reserve price until auction ends
- Seller can lower reserve during auction

**If reserve not met:**
- Auction ends but doesn't sell
- Seller may relist or contact high bidder
- You're not obligated to purchase
- No charges if reserve not met

## Winning an Auction
