# Understanding Reserve Prices

A reserve price is the minimum amount a seller is willing to accept for an item.

## How Reserve Prices Work

- **Hidden from buyers** - You won't see the reserve amount
- **Must be met** - If highest bid doesn't meet reserve, seller may not sell
- **Protects sellers** - Ensures seller gets minimum acceptable price

## What You'll See

- **"Reserve not met"** - Current bid is below reserve
- **"Reserve met"** - Current bid meets or exceeds reserve
- **No indicator** - Some listings don't have a reserve

## Bidding Strategy

- **If reserve not met**: Bid higher to meet the reserve
- **If reserve met**: You know the seller will accept if you win
- **Research value**: Know what the item is worth before bidding

## If Reserve Isn't Met

- **Seller's choice**: Seller can choose to sell anyway or not
- **No obligation**: Seller isn't required to sell below reserve
- **Contact seller**: You can message the seller to negotiate

## Tips

- Don't assume there's no reserve just because you don't see an indicator
- Bid what the item is worth to you
- Consider contacting seller if reserve isn't met
