# Auction Extensions and Sniping

Understanding how auction extensions work and bidding strategies.

## Automatic Extensions

### How It Works
- **Last-minute bids** - If bid placed in final minutes
- **Extension triggered** - Auction time extended
- **Prevents sniping** - Gives others chance to bid
- **Fair bidding** - More time for competitive bidding

### Extension Rules
- **Time added** - Usually 5-10 minutes
- **Multiple extensions** - Can extend multiple times
- **Final extension** - Eventually auction must end
- **Maximum time** - Total duration has limits

## Bidding Strategies

### Early Bidding
- **Set your bid** - Place maximum you're willing to pay
- **Let system bid** - Platform bids for you up to your max
- **Less stressful** - Don't need to watch constantly
- **May win early** - If no one else bids

### Last-Minute Bidding
- **Wait until end** - Bid in final moments
- **Surprise factor** - Others may not see it coming
- **Extension risk** - Auction may extend
- **More competitive** - Often drives price higher

### Incremental Bidding
- **Bid gradually** - Increase bids as needed
- **Stay competitive** - Keep up with other bidders
- **More control** - Adjust strategy as you go
- **More time** - Requires monitoring auction

## Tips for Buyers
