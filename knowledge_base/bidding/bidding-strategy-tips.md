# Bidding Strategy and Tips

Expert tips and strategies for successful bidding on Agchange auctions.

## Understanding Auction Dynamics

### How Auctions Work

**Auction basics:**
- Sellers set starting bid and optional reserve price
- Buyers compete by placing bids
- Highest bid wins when auction ends
- Proxy bidding (maximum bid) available
- Auction extensions prevent last-second sniping

**Key concepts:**
- **Starting bid** - Minimum first bid
- **Reserve price** - Hidden minimum seller will accept
- **Current bid** - Highest bid so far
- **Bid increment** - Minimum increase for next bid
- **Proxy bidding** - Automatic bidding up to your maximum

## Bidding Strategies

### Strategy 1: Maximum Bid (Proxy Bidding)

**How it works:**
- Set your maximum price upfront
- System bids automatically for you
- Only bids as much as needed
- Up to your maximum amount

**Best for:**
- When you know your budget
- Can't monitor auction constantly
- Want competitive advantage
- Multiple auctions to track

**Tips:**
- Set realistic maximum (don't overbid)
- Consider market value
- Factor in delivery costs
- Stick to your budget

### Strategy 2: Incremental Bidding

**How it works:**
