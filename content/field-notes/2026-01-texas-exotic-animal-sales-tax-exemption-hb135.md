Texas has **permanently eliminated sales tax on exotic animals and game animals**. Since House Bill 135 took effect on May 13, 2025, qualifying exotic animal sales are fully exempt from Texas sales and use tax. This exemption is now fully implemented across the state, improving profitability and simplifying compliance for ranchers, breeders, and buyers.

Texas leads the nation in exotic game ranching, with thousands of ranches breeding and selling axis deer, nilgai, blackbuck, fallow deer, and other species. With the removal of sales tax, buying and selling exotic animals in Texas is more efficient, more profitable, and more accessible than ever.

Whether you are a rancher selling exotic animals, a buyer looking for exotic animals for sale in Texas, or an investor building a game ranch, understanding this tax exemption is essential.

## TL;DR

- **Exotic and game animals are fully exempt** from Texas sales and use tax under Texas Tax Code §151.316(a) and House Bill 135 (effective May 13, 2025).
- The exemption applies to **all qualifying sales channels**: private ranch sales, breeders, auctions, online marketplaces (including AgChange), brokered sales, and ranch-to-ranch transfers.
- **No Ag/Timber number or exemption certificate** is required for the animal itself—the Comptroller classifies these as "always exempt."
- **Documentation** (bill of sale, identification records, transport docs) should still be maintained for compliance and audit protection.

## Are Exotic Animals Tax Exempt in Texas?

**Yes.** Under Texas Tax Code §151.316(a), exotic animals and game animals are **fully exempt** from Texas sales tax and use tax.

Qualifying exotic animal transactions do not incur sales tax, regardless of how the animal is sold or purchased.

The exemption applies to exotic animals sold through:

- Private ranch sales
- Exotic animal breeders
- Exotic animal auctions
- Online exotic animal marketplaces
- Brokered animal sales
- Ranch-to-ranch transfers

The animal itself is considered an **exempt agricultural item** under Texas law. This exemption permanently reduces transaction costs and simplifies exotic animal sales across Texas.

## What Qualifies as an Exotic Animal Under Texas Law?

Texas defines an **exotic animal** as a species of game that is **not indigenous to Texas**. These animals are commonly raised on exotic game ranches and are widely bought and sold throughout the state.

**Examples of fully tax-exempt exotic animals include:**

**Exotic deer species:**

- Axis deer
- Fallow deer
- Red deer
- Sika deer

**Exotic antelope species:**

- Nilgai
- Blackbuck antelope
- Addax
- Gemsbok
- Scimitar-horned oryx

**Other exotic hoofstock:**

- Exotic sheep species
- Exotic goat species
- Other non-native cloven-hoofed game animals

These species represent the majority of exotic animals for sale in Texas. If the animal qualifies under this definition, its sale is **fully exempt** from sales tax.

---

## Native Game Animals Are Also Fully Exempt

In addition to exotic animals, **native Texas game animals** are exempt under House Bill 135.

Examples include:

- White-tailed deer
- Mule deer
- Pronghorn antelope
- Desert bighorn sheep
- Javelina

This clarification removed previous uncertainty and confirmed that these animals are exempt agricultural items when sold.

## How Much Money Does the Exotic Animal Tax Exemption Save?

Savings can be significant. Texas sales tax ranges from **6.25% to 8.25%**, which previously added thousands of dollars to exotic animal transactions.

**Examples (at 8.25%):**

- A **$15,000 axis deer** sale previously could include up to **$1,237** in sales tax
- A **$25,000 nilgai** sale previously could include up to **$2,062** in sales tax
- A **$100,000 exotic herd** sale previously could include up to **$8,250** in sales tax
- A **$300,000 herd** sale previously could include up to **$24,750** in sales tax

Under current law, these transactions are **fully tax-exempt**. That improves profitability for ranchers and lowers acquisition costs for buyers.

---

## Does This Apply to Exotic Animals Sold Online or Through Marketplaces?

**Yes.** The exemption applies **regardless of how the animal is sold**.

Exotic animals sold through online marketplaces, ranch listings, breeders, brokers, or auctions are fully exempt from Texas sales tax if they qualify under the statutory definition.

This includes animals listed on exotic animal marketplaces like **AgChange**, which connects ranchers, breeders, and buyers across Texas.

The **sales channel does not affect the exemption**. What matters is whether the animal qualifies under Texas law.

---

## Do Buyers or Sellers Need an Ag/Timber Number or Exemption Certificate?

**No.** No exemption certificate or Ag/Timber number is required for the animal itself.

The Texas Comptroller classifies exotic animals and game animals as **"always exempt."** Sellers do not need to collect exemption forms or verify agricultural registration to treat the sale as exempt.

Sellers should still maintain proper transaction documentation (invoices, animal identification records) to support exemption classification.

---

## Documentation Ranchers and Sellers Should Maintain

Even though exotic animals are exempt, **proper records are essential** for compliance and audit protection.

**Recommended documentation:**

- Bill of sale identifying species and number of animals
- Animal identification records
- Breeder records
- Veterinary records
- Transport documentation
- Purchase and sale records

Maintaining these records ensures transactions remain compliant under Texas law.
