Field Notes is our “high-signal” library for **real transactions**—what to do, what to avoid, and how to move faster with fewer surprises.

## TL;DR (start here)

- **Buyers**: Learn how to evaluate listings, understand trust/compliance, and choose the right payment method.
- **Sellers**: Learn how to publish faster, set expectations, and get paid smoothly (without confusion).
- **Everyone**: Learn what we verify, what we don’t, and how to keep transactions on-platform.

## Who this is for

- **First-time buyers** who want to avoid mistakes and checkout friction
- **Sellers** who want listings approved quickly and payouts released cleanly
- **High-ticket buyers/sellers** (\$10k–\$50k+) who need predictable payment rails
- **Anyone** who wants to understand badges, compliance workflow, and transaction timelines

## What you’ll find here (and how to use it)

- **Guides**: step-by-step “do this next” instructions for common scenarios  
  Start: `/field-notes/guides`
- **Trust & Compliance**: plain-English explanations of badges, review, and “marketplace workflow” checks  
  Start: `/trust` and `/field-notes` (Trust category)
- **Payments**: how card vs bank transfer vs wire works at different price points, and how to prevent declines  
  Start: “Large purchases: Card vs Bank Transfer vs Wire”

## Most common questions we’ll answer

- “Why does checkout fail for large amounts?”
- “What does **Marketplace Review Complete** mean?”
- “What does it mean when funds are held until delivery confirmation?”
- “What should I do before I accept an offer?”
