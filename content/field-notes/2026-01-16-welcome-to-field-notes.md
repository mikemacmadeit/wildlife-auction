Field Notes is where we publish the practical, real-world guidance we wish every buyer and seller had.

### What you’ll find here
- **How-to guides** for listings, offers, and auctions
- **Trust & safety** education (what badges mean, what we verify, and what we don’t)
- **Payments explained** in plain English (including “funds held until delivery confirmation”)

If there’s a topic you want covered, send it to us via the Contact page.
