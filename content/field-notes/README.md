## Field Notes (Content Hub)

Add new posts here as `YYYY-MM-DD-your-slug.md`.

### Frontmatter (required)

```yaml
---
title: "Your post title"
description: "1–2 sentence summary for SEO and previews."
date: "2026-01-16"
author: "Agchange"
category: "Guides"
tags: ["payments", "trust", "transport"]
coverImage: "/images/Buck_1.webp"
featured: false
editorPick: false
---
```

### Notes
- Keep titles short and specific.
- Descriptions should be human-readable (Google shows these).
- `coverImage` should be a path under `public/` so it can be cached and shared.
- Prefer SEO-friendly guide categories and tags (examples):
  - `category: "Guides"` with tags like `["payments"]`, `["compliance"]`, `["delivery"]`, `["buying"]`, `["selling"]`
- Avoid language that implies the platform provides custody, brokerage, transport coordination, or regulatory approval.
