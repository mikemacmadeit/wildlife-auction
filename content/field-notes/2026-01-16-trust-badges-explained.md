Trust is the product.

This guide explains:
- What a **Verified Seller** badge means
- What permit/transfer checks exist for regulated categories
- How “funds held until delivery confirmation” works in practice

We never claim to be a regulator. We provide tooling and workflows to support safer transactions.
