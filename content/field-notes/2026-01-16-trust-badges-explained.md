Trust is the product—but “trust” needs to be **specific**. This guide tells you exactly what each badge means, what we verify, and what you should still verify yourself.

## TL;DR

- **Badges help reduce uncertainty**, but they are not a guarantee.
- **Marketplace Review Complete** means **workflow review**, not regulator approval.
- For regulated categories (like whitetail breeder), we verify that required documents were uploaded and reviewed—but **buyer/seller remain responsible** for compliance.
- **Protected transaction** means funds can be held until delivery/acceptance steps are completed (depending on the listing/order).

## What we verify vs what we do not

### What we *do* verify (marketplace workflow)

- **Document presence + admin review** (where required for a category/workflow)
- **Seller onboarding readiness** for payouts (seller can receive funds via Stripe Connect)
- **In-platform event trail**: bids, offers, checkout, order timeline steps, and dispute evidence

### What we *do not* verify (and you still must)

- Any **regulator approval**, permit transfer approval, or agency decision
- The animal’s physical condition, genetics, or representations beyond what the seller provides
- Transport arrangements (buyer and seller coordinate directly)

## Badge & label glossary (plain English)

### “Marketplace Review Complete” (Compliance)

- **Means**: Our admin completed the marketplace workflow review for that listing/category.
- **Does NOT mean**: TPWD/regulator approval or legal clearance for transfer.
- **Where you’ll see it**: Listing pages for animal categories.

### “Pending Review” (Compliance)

- **Means**: The listing (or required document) is waiting in an admin queue.
- **What to expect**:
  - Sellers: you may be asked to upload/confirm additional information.
  - Buyers: don’t assume “pending” equals “bad”—it often just means “in line.”

### “TPWD permit: Verified” (Whitetail breeder listings)

- **Means**: The seller uploaded a TPWD breeder permit document and our admin reviewed it as part of the marketplace workflow.
- **Does NOT mean**: Transfer approval has been granted or that any specific transfer is authorized.
- **Best practice**:
  - Buyers: confirm the permit info in the listing, and keep all payment and communication on-platform.
  - Sellers: keep permit expiration current and resubmit if anything changes.

### “Texas-only”

- **Means**: Category restrictions apply (TX residents only) for animal transactions.

### “Protected X Days”

- **Means**: The order has a protection window after delivery/receipt milestones. Funds may be held until requirements are met and/or the protection period ends.
- **Why it matters**: It creates a clear window for disputes with evidence.

### Seller trust badges (profile/listing)

These are seller-level badges that can appear on seller profiles and sometimes in listing “seller trust” areas:

- **Stripe Verified**: seller onboarding is sufficient for payouts in Stripe Connect (seller can get paid).
- **Identity verified**: identity checks have been completed (where applicable).
- **Breeder permit verified**: TPWD breeder permit document reviewed by marketplace admin (workflow verification).

## “Buy with confidence” checklist

Copy/paste this before sending an offer or bidding:

- [ ] Read the full listing description and confirm **location (TX)** where relevant.
- [ ] Check for **Compliance / Marketplace Review** badges and what they mean.
- [ ] Keep communication **in Messages**: `/dashboard/messages`
- [ ] Pay **only through checkout**—never off-platform.
- [ ] For high-ticket items, pick the payment rail that fits (see the payments guide below).
