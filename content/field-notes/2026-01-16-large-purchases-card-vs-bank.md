For smaller purchases, **card** is usually the fastest.

For high-ticket purchases, **bank rails** often have fewer surprises:
- Fewer card-limit/decline issues
- Clear funding instructions
- Better fit for \( \$20k+ \) and \( \$50k+ \) tiers

On Wildlife Exchange, **all three payment methods are available on every checkout**—we simply recommend one based on the purchase amount.
