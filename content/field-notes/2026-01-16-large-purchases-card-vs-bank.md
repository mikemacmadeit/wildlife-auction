For smaller purchases, **card** is usually the fastest.

For high-ticket purchases, **bank rails** (bank transfer or wire) usually have fewer surprises and fewer “why did my bank decline that?” moments.

## TL;DR (quick recommendation)

- **Under \$5k–\$10k**: Card is usually easiest.
- **\$10k–\$25k**: Card can work, but bank transfer often has fewer declines.
- **\$25k+**: Prefer bank transfer or wire for predictability.

Agchange can present multiple payment options at checkout; we recommend a path based on amount and reliability.

## Why large card charges fail (even if you “have the money”)

Card declines for large purchases are common because:

- **Daily purchase limits** (per card, per issuer, per merchant category)
- **Fraud/risk models** that flag unusual amounts or new merchants
- **3DS / verification requirements** that can fail silently on some banks
- **Mismatch of billing details** (address/ZIP) or travel-related account flags

### If you still want to use a card (best practices)

- Call your bank/card issuer **before** checkout and ask them to approve the charge.
- Ensure your billing address/ZIP matches exactly.
- If the charge fails once, don’t spam retries—switch rails or contact your bank first.

## Bank transfer vs wire (what’s the difference?)

### Bank transfer (ACH / bank rails)

- **Pros**: Great for high-ticket amounts; fewer card-limit issues; clear funding flow.
- **Cons**: Can require additional bank verification steps depending on your bank.
- **Best for**: Most high-ticket purchases when you want simplicity without wire complexity.

### Wire

- **Pros**: Highest predictability for very large transactions; common for \$50k+.
- **Cons**: Manual steps; bank fees; can require verified recipient details.
- **Best for**: The largest purchases or when you want the most “institutional” rail.

## What to do if checkout “couldn’t be started”

When checkout can’t start, it’s usually one of these:

- A required acknowledgment wasn’t accepted (category-specific)
- Your selected payment method needs a different verification step
- A temporary bank/issuer restriction

Best next steps:

- Try **bank transfer** (if card failed).
- If bank transfer is blocked by your bank, use **wire**.
- If you’re still stuck, capture a screenshot and contact support via `/contact`.

## Copy/paste checklist for buyers (high-ticket)

- [ ] Decide your payment rail **before** you bid/offer: card vs bank vs wire
- [ ] If using card, call your issuer for an “allow” on the amount
- [ ] Keep all communication in `/dashboard/messages`
- [ ] Pay only through Agchange checkout (never off-platform)
